# In-Depth-Data-Analysis-with-SQL

## 📌 Project Goal
This project focuses on performing detailed analysis on two databases — **IMDB** and **Magist** — using advanced SQL techniques. The aim is to improve analysis speed, reduce effort, and help future analysts work more efficiently.

---

## 📖 Overview
This repository contains two separate SQL analyses:

### **1. IMDB Database Analysis**
A complete study of the IMDB database using advanced SQL features to make analysis faster and clearer.

### **2. Magist Database Revisit**
A deeper follow-up to an earlier Magist project. This includes adding new tables, integrating them into the existing database, and using stored routines for a more powerful analysis process.

## 🔍 Approach

### **IMDB Analysis**
- Explored the IMDB dataset in detail  
- Used CTEs, Window Functions, Stored Functions, and Stored Procedures  
- Focused on long-term efficiency through reusable SQL routines  

### **Magist Analysis**
- Continued from a previous project  
- Added and connected new tables to the current database  
- Used stored routines to speed up the analysis  
- Performed raw data transformation for better insights
